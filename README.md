# RelativeScenesAPI
This API allows you to rotate and move scenes and cameras from the Blockbuster and Aperture mods. This allows you to create relative and absolute cutscenes for the map.

The latest version now supports working with scenes that contain several actors, rotation preserves their positioning relative to each other.
## Usage
Scripts are implemented in 2 main files:
- RelativeScenesAPI.js
- RelativeCameraAPI.js

Since the API implementations in the Mappet and CustomNPCs mods are different, we divided the use of the script into the corresponding folders. 
Each of them works with the main script, you can independently combine them into one file if you wish, or connect separately.

## P.S.
Development was carried out for several years, now we have brought the script to an acceptable version, but due to low demand - work and improvements are stopped and may not be continued. You have access to different examples of implementations, so look at the version history if for some reason you are interested in previous implementations and they work in your case
